    </p>
    <p class="help-normal">
        What is SKYNET? It is an online logical language and development system. Logical like Prolog. Yes and no. It is more like a full calculation engine where what is unknown is calculated from what is unknown. It is an object oriented OO, lazy functional, logical language based on calculation, not &quot;negation as failure&quot;. The works.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 class="help-heading2">Why?</h2>
    <p class="help-normal">
        SKYNET supports web integrated web development. You design your application right there on the page, and create objects that are persisted to the database. One development environment. One language for everything. No learning SQL. All your queries are defined in logic. The objects just exist. You define their behaviour in logic.
    </p>
    <p class="help-normal">
        You can run the application as you develop it and see the result before your eyes.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2 class="help-heading2">Mickey Mouse?</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="help-normal">
        SKYNET is a powerful meta-programming language. Once you have writen the logic, you can optimize it and generate fast C++ code that will run at lightspeed. All without the pain of writing C++. Parts of your application can be in generated C++, called from your flexible, instantly editable interpreted environment.
    </p>
    <p class="help-normal">
        If you are a business you can deploy your SKYNET application on your own machines, or in the cloud. It is easy.</p>
