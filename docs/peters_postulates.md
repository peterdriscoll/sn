# Peter's Postulates

A growing collection of guiding principles and insights, expressed as
"postulates."\
These are intended as reference points for both philosophical reflection
and practical design thinking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Postulate N -- On Human Value-Seeking

*Most young (and perhaps immature) humans seek to differentiate
themselves from others in ways that make them (appear) valuable and
perhaps important.*

-   This explains competitive tension and conflict when many try to
    assert importance at once.\
-   The wiser response is to recognize the shared need for value and
    defuse tension.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Postulate H -- Humanity vs. Government

*A people are not their government. To conflate the two is to confuse
power with personhood.*

-   If we condemn a corrupt or oppressive government, our logic obliges
    us to extend compassion, not condemnation, to the people living
    under it.\
-   Before casting judgment outward, we are bound to confront and
    improve the flaws in our own system of governance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Postulate X – Sexuality, Tribalism, and Empathy

Male sexuality, shaped by ancestral competition for mates and status, narrows empathy by reinforcing tribal boundaries: it favors the in-group, distrusts the out-group, and objectifies partners as symbols of dominance.
To be humane in a modern world, we must decouple sexuality from tribal rivalry and expand empathy beyond inherited instincts.

## Postulate R

When a system is built to protect revenue first, compassion is taxed and kindness is penalised.
