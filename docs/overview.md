# SN Documentation Overview

Welcome to the documentation for SN (Symbolic Narrowing), a symbolic logic engine designed to reason over sets of possibilities without exponential branching.

This directory contains foundational concepts and deeper technical details. Start here:

---

## Core Concepts

- [Core Principles of SN Reasoning](./principles.md)  
  Symbolic narrowing, conditional value sets, minimum cardinality, and delayed processing.

---

## Planned Topics

_(You can add these later as needed.)_

- `meta-evaluation.md` — How SN handles Meta and Unmeta operations for introspection.
- `inheritance.md` — Symbolic reasoning over class hierarchies: IsA, HasA, Virtual.
- `type-system.md` — Early-phase typing, literal parameters, and structural type matching.
- `delayed-processing.md` — Mechanisms for deferring and retrying evaluation safely.
- `examples.md` — Illustrative SN programs and how they resolve.

This documentation is evolving alongside the SN system. Suggestions welcome.
