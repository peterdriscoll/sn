# Promotions

In SN's Promotional Garbage Collection (PGC) system, **promotion** is the process by which an object allocated in one transaction is transferred to another transaction with a longer lifetime. This is necessary when symbolic data must outlive the transaction that created it.

---

## Purpose

Symbolic computations often require **returning values**, **retaining state**, or **building recursive structures** across transaction boundaries. Without promotion, all such objects would be destroyed at the end of their original transaction.

---

## Core Mechanism

### 1. Promotion Requests

When a pointer is updated to reference an object from a different transaction, a **promotion request** is registered.

```cpp
Ref<T> r;
r = objFromShortLivedTransaction;
```

- The `Ref<T>` wrapper detects the cross-transaction assignment.
- It registers a `PGC_Promotion` instance containing:
  - A pointer to the object.
  - A reference to the destination transaction.
  - A back-pointer to the reference (`T**`) so it can be updated after promotion.

### 2. Processing Promotion Requests

At the end of the transaction (destruction phase), all promotion requests are processed:

- If the **source transaction is dying**, and the **destination is still alive**, the object is **promoted** (copied into the destination).
- The pointer in the original reference is updated.
- If the **destination is dying**, or any conditions are invalid, the request is silently discarded.

### 3. Promotion Object Lifecycle

Promotion requests are stored in a linked list and reused:

- Active promotions are tracked using `m_PromoteList`.
- When a promotion is complete or rejected, its object is returned to a **free list** for reuse.

---

## Memory Safety

The promotion system ensures that:

- References do not dangle across transactions.
- Only valid cross-transaction references are promoted.
- All objects are copied exactly once, even in cyclic structures.

To avoid accidental use-after-free, objects being promoted are handled *before* memory is released, and references are updated atomically.

---

## Debugging Notes

- Use `Promotion::PromotionUsedMemory()` to track active promotions.
- `PGC_Promotion::PromoteRequests()` handles the processing loop.
- Conditional debugging hooks can be added during promotion to verify invariants.

## Promotion Patterns

| Pattern                         | Behavior                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Cross-transaction pointer write | Registers a promotion request              |
| Source transaction ends         | Request processed, object copied if needed |
| Destination transaction ends    | Promotion rejected, pointer left unchanged |
| Object already promoted         | Promotion reuses existing copy             |

---

## Summary

Promotion is central to SNâ€™s memory safety across symbolic computations. It enables rich, recursive, and persistent structures to be built transactionally while keeping garbage collection deterministic and efficient.
